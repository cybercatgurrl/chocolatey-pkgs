# [lf](https://chocolatey.org/packages/lf)

lf (as in "list files") is a terminal file manager written in Go.

## Features

- Cross-platform (Linux, OSX, BSDs, Windows (partial))
- Single binary without any runtime dependencies (except for terminfo database)
- Fast startup and low memory footprint (due to native code and static binaries)
- Server/client architecture to share file selection between multiple instances
- Configuration with shell commands
- Customizable keybindings (vi and readline defaults)
- Preview filtering (for source highlight, archives, pdfs/images as text etc.)
